<h6 class="text-left" style="font-size: 16px;">PROJECT | Actve <br>
        ROLE | UI/UX Researcher and Designer <br>
        DURATION | Two Weeks</h6>
<hr>

<h2 class="h2"><u><em>Introduction</em></u></h2>
<p>We realized that there is no app out their that purely focuses on the social media aspects of fitness, but through research we realized fitness apps and social media apps are some of the most used apps. Together as a group we combine the idea to create Actve. A social media platform that focuses on a personal as well as group fitness. </p>


<h2 class="h2 
text-right"><u><em>Challenges</em></u></h2>
<p> The project was to fully understand all the aspects of <b> UX Research </b> as well as start learning the  fundamentals of <b>Prototyping.</b> We covered a vast majority of UX Research techniques but the challenge was to make sure every technique was used and utilized as well as necessary for the app.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><u><em>Discovery</em></u></h2>
<p> It was important to not only create an App that doesn't exist but create one the users use. To create this App we had to create a process that uniquely identifies what makes people binge and app versus what makes them turn away from an app. 
<br>
    At first we narrowed down which exact direction we wanted to go. How we did that was first we did <strong>broad interviews,</strong> we questioned which Apps they used, why they used them, and how often. This helped us realized that some of the most used apps out there is fitness and social medias. <br>
    After we decided to move forward with a social media fitness App. We created a <strong>proto-persona.</strong> We wanted to know what our perfect user would be. Based off of our screening surveys and interviews we were able to understand our future users, perfect or not. 
    
    
    
    
    
    We did surveys, interviews, mind mapping, affinity diagrams, and after all that figured out our problem statement.</p>
<p><em>We believe that the health and fitness community currently do not have a single all in one platform about fitness and health where they are able to connect and blog easily to their audience. By making it possible to socially share their pictures, videos, and articles, we may solve this problem by signing up and retaining 100,000 users within the next 2 years and will help increase brand exposure. We know we have succeeded when we see new clients and long-term retainment and engagement.</em></p>
<p>After the problem statement was created we focused more on our user persona, competitive analysis, scenario, user journey, and storyboard. We made sure to exploit our research to make an in depth paper prototype.</p>
